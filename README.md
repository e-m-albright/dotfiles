# TODO - regret, installed caffeine don't like sticky bad software
Does it matter? maybe not. I do not like having software that's hard to remove

caffeine is built for Intel macOS and so requires Rosetta 2 to be installed.
You can install Rosetta 2 with:
    softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
Note that it is very difficult to remove Rosetta 2 once it is installed.

Rather just go with amphetamine but they don't offer a brew install


worth trying instead of oh-my-zsh: https://fishshell.com/


Try obsidian?
brew install --cask obsidian

# clone obsidian vault (i use obsidian-git for syncing)
git clone git@github.com:<github-username>/<obsidian-vault>.git


brew install ollama
ollama serve

# in another terminal, pull some models to try
ollama pull llama3.2 nemotron  # 3B and 70B respectively

# WTF is this
uv tool install open-webui
uv tool run open-webui serve

This thing?
https://www.raycast.com/ - replaces rectangle too, and the clipboard helper I got?

https://wisprflow.ai/ - dictation?
